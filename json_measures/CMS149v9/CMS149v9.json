Both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms of dementia tend to evolve over time, so regular monitoring allows detection of new symptoms and adaptation of treatment strategies to current needs... Cognitive symptoms that almost always require assessment include impairments in memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities. It is often helpful to track cognitive status with a structured simple examination (American Psychiatric Association, 2007).\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association recommends that patients with dementia be assessed for the type, frequency, severity, pattern, and timing of symptoms (Category 1C). Quantitative measures provide a structured replicable way to document the patient's baseline symptoms and determine which symptoms (if any) should be the target of intervention based on factors such as frequency of occurrence, magnitude, potential for associated harm to the patient or others, and associated distress to the patient. The exact frequency at which measures are warranted will depend on clinical circumstances. However, use of quantitative measures as treatment proceeds allows more precise tracking of whether nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments are having their intended effect or whether a shift in the treatment plan is needed (American Psychiatric Association, 2016).\n\nConduct and document an assessment and monitor changes in cognitive status using a reliable and valid instrument, e.g., MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), AD8 (Ascertian Dementia 8) or other tool. Cognitive status should be reassessed periodically to identify sudden changes, as well as to monitor the potential beneficial or harmful effects of environmental changes (including safety, care needs, and abuse and/or neglect), specific medications (both prescription and non-prescription, for appropriate use and contraindications), or other interventions. Proper assessment requires the use of a standardized, objective instrument that is relatively easy to use, reliable (with less variability between different assessors), and valid (results that would be similar to gold-standard evaluations) (California Department of Public Health, 2017).\n\nRecommendation: Perform regular, comprehensive person-centered assessments and timely interim assessments.\nAssessments, conducted at least every 6 months, should prioritize issues that help the person with dementia to live fully. These include assessments of the individual and care partner’s relationships and subjective experience and assessment of cognition, behavior, and function, using reliable and valid tools. Assessment is ongoing and dynamic, combining nomothetic (norm based) and idiographic (individualized) approaches (Fazio, Pace, Maslow, Zimmerman, \u0026 Kallmyer, 2018)\n\nRecommendation: Assess cognitive status, functional abilities, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, medical status, living environment, and safety.
