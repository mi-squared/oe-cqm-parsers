Pain is a commonly occurring symptom for cancer patients as 30% to 50% (510,000 to 850,000 each year based on current statistics) will experience moderate to severe pain (Wiffen, Wee, Derry, Bell, \u0026 Moore, 2017). Initial and ongoing pain assessments are essential to determine the pathophysiology of pain and ensure proper pain management. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), there is increasing evidence in oncology that survival is linked to symptom reporting and control and that pain management contributes to broad quality-of-life improvement (2018). Cancer patients have reported that pain interferes with their mood, work, relationships with other people, sleep and overall enjoyment of life (Moryl et al., 2018). To maximize patient outcomes, pain management is an essential part of oncologic management (NCCN, 2018).\n\nA recent analysis of registry data for chronic pain cancer patients found average pain intensity reported as mild (24.6% of patients), moderate (41.5%), and severe (33.9%). The study also indicated that patient report of pain relief is inversely related to the average pain intensity reported (Moryl et al., 2018). These data suggest that assessing and managing a cancer patient’s pain is critical and there remains significant room for improvement in assessing and mitigating cancer-related pain. A prospective study of changes in pain severity of cancer patients found that, at initial assessment, 47% of patients reported pain. At follow-up, the patients with pain at initial assessment reported reduced pain (32.2%), stable pain (48.2%) and worse pain (19.6%). Of the 53% of patients reporting no pain at initial assessment, 82.6% reported stable pain and 17.4% reported worse pain at follow-up assessment (Zhao et al., 2014).
